#Solution of the Poisson equation within the domain [0,1] using

* Discretization is done both using second order Finite Difference schemes

* Dirichlet boundary conditions is implemented on both the boundaries

* The resulting linear algebraic system is solved using 

# TDMA (Thomas algorithm)

# Gauss-Jacobi algorithm

# Gauss-Seidel algorithm

# Successive Over-Relaxation method
